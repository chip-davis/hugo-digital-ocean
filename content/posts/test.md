hello! my name is chip davis and this is my portfolio site.

i am passionate about all things computer science
and programming (except web development :) ) which is why this site is powered by hugo.
i graduated from depaul university in 2022 with a bachelors degree in computer science.
my favorite programming languages are python, rust, and java but i am always learning more.
take a look around and read my blog or look at some of my projects.
